# ToDo-list
ToDo list in javascript.
Made by Sagiv Salmanov (Bagiwka).
Project I did for an internship for school:

normaly uses html requests but changed because there's no database anymore (as a comment).
can create, delete, view and finish (and save through html requests).
no frameworks (not even jquery sadly).
